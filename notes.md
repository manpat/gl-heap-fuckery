## ideas
special case compute dispatches for image processing
- read GL_COMPUTE_WORK_GROUP_SIZE to determine how many groups to dispatch to cover an image

infer element count for indexed draws



## goals
- single global pipeline containing stages that can be rendered into
- stages describe framebuffer layout and optionally default bindings
